A repository to showcase myself.

Terminal is a developer's first love.
There is no denying that life would have been meaningless for us devs without a terminal.

Thus I decided to dedicate my personal page to terminals, designing the page in a very
dev-friendly way.

In trying to emulate a terminal-like design, i've used the ubuntu 14.04 default terminal color scheme
and commands.(Though for obvious reasons, only the necessary commands have been included)

For people unfamiliar with the command-line, I do intend to make a "normal" personal page, as I wouldn't
want to miss on any opportunity to promote myself.
